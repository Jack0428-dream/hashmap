creating HashMap manually

Given conditions
creating "HashMap" class or factory function 
should have two variables for "load factor" and capacity
a load factor of 0.75 you should have an initial capacity of size 16.

Methods 
1. "hash(key)" : takes a key and produces a hash code with it

2. "set(key, value)" : takes two arguments 
    - 1: first is a key 2: second is a value 
    - if a key alreayd exists, then the old value is overwritten 
    - we update the key's value 

3. "get(key)" : takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return "null"

4. "has(key)" : takes a key as an argument and returns "true" or "false" based on whether or not the key is in the hash map

5. "remove(key)" : takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true.
If the key isn't in the hash map, it should return false.

6. "length()" returns the number of stored keys in the hash map

7. "clear()" removes all entries in the hash map

8. "keys()" returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map

9. "values()" returns an array containing all the values

10. "entries()" returns an array that contains each key, value pair. 
ex - [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]
